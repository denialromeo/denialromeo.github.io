    <p>With this guide, you’re going to start with a computer connected to the Internet and end up with your own <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a>-generated website hosted on <a href="https://pages.github.com">Github Pages</a> like this one!</p>

<p>Maintaining a website is free, educational, and fun. You’re in for a treat!</p>

  <li><a href="#share" id="markdown-toc-share">Step 3: Going Public</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="install" class="toc-heading">Step 1: Installation</h2>

<p>I assume you’re using Windows. If you’re on a Mac, just replace Scoop with <a href="https://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a>.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Open your command prompt (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Windows key</code>, type <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cmd</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Enter</code>) and install <a href="http://scoop.sh">Scoop</a> –</p>

    <div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code> powershell Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned <span class="nt">-scope</span> CurrentUser
 powershell iex <span class="o">(</span>new-object net.webclient<span class="o">)</span>.downloadstring<span class="o">(</span><span class="s1">'https://get.scoop.sh'</span><span class="o">)</span>
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Use Scoop to install Git, Make, MSYS2, Ruby, and Wget, then configure Git.</p>

    <div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code> scoop <span class="nb">install </span>git
 scoop bucket add versions extras
 scoop <span class="nb">install </span>make msys2 ruby27 wget
 git config <span class="nt">--global</span> user.name <span class="s2">"Your Name"</span>
 git config <span class="nt">--global</span> user.email <span class="s2">"Your E-mail"</span>
</code></pre></div>    </div>

    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a> is how you’ll push your website to Github Pages.</li>
      <li><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/">Make</a> lets you run makefiles, which simplify commands.</li>
      <li><a href="https://www.msys2.org/">MSYS2</a> helps with installing Ruby gems on Windows.</li>
      <li><a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a> is the language Jekyll is written in. You’ll use <a href="https://rubygems.org/">RubyGems</a> to install Jekyll.</li>
      <li><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/">Wget</a> lets you download files from the Internet through the command prompt.
 <span style="display:block;margin-bottom:15px;"></span></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Close and re-open the command prompt, then install Jekyll.</p>

    <div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code> gem <span class="nb">install </span>jekyll
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this tutorial, we’re going to use a makefile. Here’s what it contains –</p>

    <div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code> g:
     git add <span class="nt">--all</span> <span class="nb">.</span>
     git commit <span class="nt">-m</span> <span class="s2">"New website commit."</span>
     git push origin master

 l:
     jekyll build
     jekyll serve <span class="nt">--incremental</span> <span class="nt">--port</span> 8000
</code></pre></div>    </div>

    <p>When placed in the directory containing your website, this will enable two commands –</p>

    <ul>
      <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">make g</code> will push your website to Github Pages for public view.</li>
      <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">make l</code> will run your website on your own computer at <a href="http://localhost:8000">http://localhost:8000</a>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="local" class="toc-heading">Step 2: Running Locally</h2>

<p>Go ahead and browse through the large selection of themes at <a href="http://jekyllthemes.org/">jekyllthemes.org</a>, pick one you like, and navigate to its Github repo. (My favorite is <a href="http://jekyllthemes.org/themes/dentistsmile/">DentistSmile</a>.)</p>

<p>Clone your theme, enter the new directory, download the makefile, and serve!</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>git clone <span class="s2">"https://github.com/gabrsar/dentistsmile"</span>
<span class="nb">cd </span>dentistsmile
wget <span class="s2">"http://danielmoore.us/jekyll-tutorial/makefile"</span>
make l
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now visit <a href="http://localhost:8000">http://localhost:8000</a>. Voila!</p>

<p>If <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">make l</code> failed, here’s a few trouble-shooting tips.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Google the error message and install any missing gems with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gem install &lt;gem&gt;</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some Jekyll themes use <a href="https://bundler.io/">Bundler</a>, so if needed, run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gem install bundler</code>, then <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">notepad makefile</code> and edit to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bundle exec jekyll serve --incremental --port 8000</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">notepad _config.yml</code> and add the line <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">exclude: [vendor]</code>.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="share" class="toc-heading">Step 3: Going Public</h2>

<p>Create and sign into a <a href="https://github.com">Github</a> account.</p>

<p>Create new repository <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;your username&gt;.github.io</code>, then return to your command prompt.</p>

<p>Remove the existing local repository, start a new one, point it to Github, and push to remote.</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">rmdir</span> /s /q .git
git init
git remote add origin <span class="s2">"https://github.com/&lt;username&gt;/&lt;username&gt;.github.io"</span>
make g
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Wait a minute, then visit <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;your username&gt;.github.io</code> in a browser. Your website should be live! From now on, to update your public website, just run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">make g</code>.</p>

<p>(You can get Git to remember your Github credentials by running one of the commands <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/caching-your-github-password-in-git/">here</a>.)</p>

<p>Phew! That was a wild ride, but you now have your own website!</p>

<center><div style="width:75%;margin-right:0%;display:inline-block"><div class="video-container">
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oyFQVZ2h0V8" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</div></div></center>
<p><span style="display:block;margin-bottom:15px;"></span></p>

<p>A few final tips –</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>You should develop for yourself locally by running <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">make l</code> and reserve <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">make g</code> for when you want to make changes public.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Jekyll uses <a href="https://shopify.github.io/liquid/">Liquid</a> and <a href="https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet">Markdown</a>. Be familiar with both and read Jekyll’s <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/">documentation</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Get comfortable with a text editor. <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a> is popular. Consider learning <a href="https://www.vim.org/">Vim</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Jekyll was written by Tom Preston-Werner, the founder of Github. For a cool bit of history, check out his <a href="http://tom.preston-werner.com/2008/11/17/blogging-like-a-hacker.html">blog post</a> announcing his invention.</p>
