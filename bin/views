Retirement plans -

* Immediate to-dos -
  
  * Exercise (going well - keep that up).
  * Work through Set Your Voice Free.
  * Watch two films a week.
  * Start traveling to San Francisco weekly and doing tourist circuits while wearing the shoes.

* Aim to get laid off with severance. You should be able to qualify for unemployment as well that way.

  (I understand the urge to quit, but remember that unemployment is $10800 and severance/PTO will be ~15k besides.
   Fake stress and sadness and mental problems to get laid off if you must, but do not quit.)

  (Though, honestly, 25k in T-Bills is equivalent to the effect of stopping your exorbitant weekly shaves. So if you
   really want to quit, feel free. At the very least, just lie rather than doing real work as much as you can.
   Maybe you can get fired for being caught in a lie or something like that.)

  (There's probably no way of avoiding some acrimonious confrontation, unfortunately. Even if you turn in a two weeks'
   notice, they'll ask you to show your work, which will necessarily out you as having been shirking off. Might as well
   be caught later than sooner. Try to remember that confrontation has no negative consequences for you. Just decline
   Zoom meetings or hang up if things get tense.)

  AI/saturation/RTO/recession mean your career is basically over. You should be able to live off investment earnings
  for the rest of your life. Maybe start an enterprise in the third world to remain occupied. Porn geared towards women?
  AI-enabled coffee plantation?

  Congratulations on surviving these past 2.5 years. Remember that you started this journey with 50k saved. Ending with
  850k means 1700% gains, and never needing to work again. You've saved yourself a lifetime of misery. Use your
  remaining life wisely and do not be an idler and thief of time.

  Consider leaving for Ahmedabad/Mumbai/Goa at some point. Though remember, there's no rush whatsoever. You have a useful
  lifespan of 40 years left, meaning you should always be making moves with an eye on the decade ahead.

  1. You'll be physically and mentally ready to enjoy everything life has to offer.
  2. The big recession we've been anticipating since 2020 will have hit, wiping out the service economy and with it
     your mortal enemy the white man. You'll have won the game and have no more to gain. (Along these lines, avoid doing
     anything aggressive before the recession, as that will likely solve all your problems anyways. "Nothing rash before
     the crash!")
  3. I assume you don't want to spend your whole life in a one-bedroom apartment and dating aging fat women with
     student loans. (Your living situation right now is actually very good. Upgrading to a worse two-bedroom would be
     foolish. So your next abode has to be a decently large estate around friendly people. There's no way to make
     that work in America, so you'll need to head out.)

  Also consider Bangkok/Da Nang/Manila, Mexico City/Rio de Janeiro/Sao Paulo, Lisbon/Barcelona/Nice,
  and Odessa/Moscow/St. Petersburg. Maybe rotate between locales seasonally.
  
  Try sticking to areas well-worn by whites before you. The idea is to supplant them as globalization ends. Try reading
  literature by them from the 1950's to 1970's to model yourself after. Wherever you live, try to rent an apartment in a
  professional neighborhood near an elementary school.

  Become physically strong and good at dating. Then feel free to head out. It's a big world, and your standard of living
  should improve once you're out. You're guaranteed to become a multi-millionaire if your expenses are slashed.

* Work through Set Your Voice Free. The goal is to have a commanding, authoritative presence.
* Watch Before Sunrise and read Double Your Dating
* Read the Mexico/Philippines expat guides.
* Work through Bittman cookbooks.
* Work through MIT OpenCourseWare (Linear Algebra)
* Watch two classic films every week.
* Read classic novels and counter-narrative history books.
* Play through Steam backlog. Try touching most things, go in-depth for the masterpieces.
* Read through Kindle backlog. Try touching most things, go in-depth for the masterpieces.
* Buy weed and taser.
* Eye exam, ICICI bank account.
* Start going out weekly on your own wearing the shoes once your leg heals. Beach, golf lessons, etc.

Sex goals -

* Remember, the core of dating is the sex act. Until you have it mastered, there's little point. Your limiting factor
  really is physicality, so you need to get that taken care of ASAP. Try to be up to the standards of the domination
  wrestling pornos.
* Exercise. Goal is to achieve baseline competency in bench press/squat/deadlift and be a good lover.
* Start regularly fucking your fleshlights while they're on the bed. Film yourself.
  Fleshlight sitting -> Fleshlight with condom sitting -> Fleshlight on bed -> Fleshlight with condom on bed
  Wake up, pop Bluechew, stand-up, fleshlight.
* Start going out on your own. Restaurants, amusement parks, zoos. Always wearing the shoes, always keeping an eye out.
* Take up golf and fishing. Eventually be able to head out to the links or rent a boat and sail out.
* Once mastered, start visiting an escort weekly.
* Set up fake Tinder/Bumble/Hinge profiles as a female. Scope out the competition.
* Goal is a long-term relationship with an 18-21 who's deeply dependent on you. Refuse marriage. To spice things up, you
  share the occasional hooker with her in a three-some. Every 5-10 years, switch to a younger model.

Dating protocol -

* Claim to be 22 and a software engineer at __. (As economy collapses, may be able to drop pretense.)
* Keep the pepper spray on you.

Resumes being filtered out by racist HR, most likely.

https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w9873/w9873.pdf

I actually legally changed my first and last name to get past this filter. Resume response rate went from 25% to close to 100%. Extremely depressing. I advocate for all Asians to legally change our names.

At the company where I work, I'm in a position where I get to choose who we hire. But I don't get to filter the resumes myself. HR (who are led by this smug white supremacist) always send us these idiot white candidates.

One overqualified Chinese guy somehow made it through the filter and we hired him immediately, but otherwise, I've just been trying to hire white women where possible. Incompetent white women largely keep to themselves. Incompetent white males cause trouble and often try to make the non-white employees miserable.

"Hi.

My name is Daniel. I came across your profile on Preferred411 and would like to set up an appointment.

Are you available at 7pm on ___ for an hour? Some other time this weekend is also fine. I live in Fremont, and can drop by Pleasanton.

Let me know what details you need. I've also requested an appointment through P411.

Thank you for your time. Look forward to hearing from you."

---

My criteria for "non-racist" is depressingly low.

Basically, you just have to say one normal, nice, non-patronizing thing about a non-white group. Just one sentence that isn't steeped in some horrible bigotry.

99.9% of white guys that I see on TV or that I've met IRL fail this. The younger ones are often worse than the older ones. It's insane.

---

I've always felt like both mainstream political parties, and white people in general, were out to get me.

You could call me a pseudo-leftist, I think. I'm very passionate about racial issues, and am willing to co-sign most feminist measures. But I'm not really a socialist. If I lived in Sweden, for example, I'd be paying a lot of taxes so white factory workers could have five kids and raise them all to hate me.

That said, I do believe in the right of all peoples to pursue their own destiny. I like China mostly because they don't try imposing their beliefs on other countries. They keep to themselves. Which is cool.

---

Thanks!

Darker-skinned women of all types. Black, Indian, Filipina. I live in the SF Bay Area. Most of my matches are black or Indian.

The occasional white woman sometimes matches with me, but that tends to fizzle out. I think it doesn't help that I associate white women with white men, a group I try to avoid as much as I can. When I start talking about race issues on dates, black women tend to nod along, while white women act like I insulted their religion, hahaha.

The one group I have zero success with is East Asian women. I went on a date to the local Egyptian museum with a Vietnamese girl once, but Chinese/Japanese/Korean women have basically no interest. Not sure why. I had some really great WhatsApp conversations with this Chinese girl in Shanghai who was using Tinder Passport, so I think it's an Asian-American thing.

But yeah, 3 dates, then sex/relationship. I think it's pretty standard.

(Sorry for the ramble. I rarely discuss my love-life.)

---

Indian-American here. Honestly, white-worshipping by Indian-American women is more of a class issue than a race issue.
The issue is that white-collar work and associated institutions (universities, HR departments, etc.) are strongly gate-kept
by white males, so Indian-American women are more or less indoctrinated into "white is right" BS. Ironically, most white
guys are downwardly socially mobile, so the Indian-American women who think this way are probably screwing over their own kids.

After staring at the state of affairs for a few years, I legally changed my name so I could have a career and started
dating working-class black women (who often despise white guys, which I love).

Yesterday, I had a 1:1 with my white, Gen X boss. We started talking about the Russia-Ukraine War, and he mentioned that
India's a "damn mess" because of the "Hindu-Muslim thing". I just nodded along sagely. A month ago he was pro-India as a
possible weapon to use against China, but now that the news is negative about India, he's apparently a crusader for Muslim
rights. Even though he almost certainly supported the invasions of Iraq/Afghanistan. Goddamn NPC.

When I meet a male like this, I try to help the guy out, but self-hating women may be a lost cause (I suspect women are
more susceptible to social pressure).

I don't want children, so I'm happy as a clam with my situation, but if I did, I'd probably move to India. I don't think
the U.S. in its current state is a good place to raise a non-white family.

When back on Tinder, set age to 22, start with good-looking image.

5'11".

I like to visit somewhere new around the Bay Area most weekends. Join me!

Let's share drinks at the beach! Or hang out at the museum! Or grab lunch. Or whatever.

"Hey, beautiful. :) "

"I'm sure you get this a lot, but you look really good."

---

Yes, but they outnumber us, and so they can exclude us.

I encourage you to change the name on your resume to one like "David Martin" and see how many more interview requests you get. The whites are screwing you over without you even knowing it.

Or, at least, this has so far been the case. As rent prices have increased over the past year, there's been a mass exodus of whites from my apartment complex, and Indian tech workers have been moving in. It's been nice.

---

What I want -

Someone to take places.
Someone young and pretty whom I can spend a few years with.

What she wants -

A father figure to take care of her.
An aggressive man who physically dominates her and potential threats.
Someone with money to take her places.
Someone to rail her well (though as a lower priority/reward for earlier three).

What we both want -

Someone to share a bed with.

You're always told that pain can be a catalyst for growth. "No pain, no gain." "Whatever doesn't kill me only makes me
stronger." So on and so forth.

But in every example I've ever seen, people who suffer only end up worse off. They just become committed to making
other people suffer, such that the pain they suffer ends up spread to others for no good reason.

It's a serious problem that has totally warped world history. Hitler projecting Germany's humiliations after World War 1
onto Europe's Jewish minority and murdering millions of people. Muslims who deal with living in a totalitarian death
cult by committing terrorist acts and torturing non-Muslims. Western white males "left behind" because they couldn't
compete in a globalized world who dedicate their whole lives to trying to humiliate non-whites (mostly on the Internet,
since they can't really afford to exist in public these days).

Everywhere I look, I see nothing but pain and hurt people hurting people. It feels like a death spiral which can only
end in mass death. It feels like an inescapable problem endemic to life itself.

Maybe a solution is to send most males to labor camps, while at the same time engineering new births to be 90% female
through artificial insemination. That feels like a paradise and the true apotheosis of industrial society. Far better
than our present reality where we seem to have two world wars every century for no good reason.

I think the U.S. pulls an absurdly cruel trick on women and white males where it coddles them for the first two decades
of their lives and encourages them to go into absurd student debt to engage in self-destructive hedonistic behavior.

Then, once they graduate from college, it pulls the rug out from under them and sentences them to a lifetime of labor
trying and failing to pay back the debt while inflation makes them poorer each passing year.

Non-white males (like myself) usually know the score and aren't taken in by the delusion. (Though some, particularly if
lighter-skinned or gay, still are.)

In the case of women, they're also sold an illusion that a line of rich simps are waiting to marry them once they're done
having fun in their twenties. But any rational male these days avoids marriage and children. So they're kind of screwed.

Full realization of the situation they're in doesn't set until their thirties, when it's too late to really change their
life trajectory. So they have no choice but to spend five or six decades taking the loss while being abused by guys like
me who used those crucial first three decades properly. Karma.

---

I veer back and forth between envying and pitying younger people.

On the one hand, they have far better resources available than I did. Many dreams I had since I was young only started
coming true recently because of new tools like ChatGPT making it possible for me to find resources.

On the other hand, they have much worse earning prospects, in part because of things like ChatGPT. Human beings are
quickly becoming obsolete, and failing to become rich now results in horrifying consequences.

---

As far as I can tell, most men who have ever lived have been miserable.

The average man, from antiquity to present, was working long hours for someone else, sexually frustrated, and forced to
suffer pointless insults and bigotry.

Male wild animals probably suffer similarly.

Hi Emil,

Would it be possible for me to be included in the next round of lay-offs?

I really wouldn't mind. I may need to head to India for an extended period (my mother), and severance/unemployment benefits would be very appreciated.

(I'd also be fine leaving sooner with a severance if that's more convenient.)

---

Hi guys,

My mother's doing pretty poorly health-wise (she was in a bad car accident last year).

I think I need to head to India for an extended period (likely a year-plus).

Putting in my two weeks' notice today. Planned final day is Friday, July 26.

I have some accumulated PTO. I assume this will be paid out? Let me know details for shipping back my laptop.

It's been great working with everyone. Will make sure to transition everything I've been doing before leaving.

Thank you!


I've been thinking of spending some extended time (a year-plus) in India so I can be closer to my mother. (She was in a bad car accident last year.)

I know I'm officially part of the IT team, but is there any chance I could opt to be part of the chapter team's voluntary lay-off? The offered severance/unemployment benefits seem pretty good to me.

If this is possible, I can loop in Emil and Jes (my manager). If this isn't possible, I'm happy to drop this topic and won't bring it up again.

Thank you!

Women are only really attractive between ages 20 and 25.

This means that every 5 years there's a complete turnover in the ranks of attractive women.

And yet, they're so arrogant. It makes no sense.
