Retirement plans -

* Aim to get laid off with severance. You should be able to qualify for unemployment as well that way.

  (I understand the urge to quit, but remember that unemployment is $10800 and severance/PTO will be ~15k besides.
   Fake stress and sadness and mental problems to get laid off if you must, but do not quit.)

  AI/saturation/RTO/recession mean your career is basically over. You should be able to live off investment earnings
  for the rest of your life. Maybe start an AI-enabled enterprise in the third world to remain occupied.

  Congratulations on surviving these past 2.5 years. Remember that you started this journey with 50k saved. Ending with
  850k means 1700% gains, and never needing to work again. You've saved yourself a lifetime of misery. Use your
  remaining life wisely and do not be an idler and thief of time.

  Consider leaving for Mumbai/Goa/Kerala in 2025 or 2026. By then -

  1. You'll be physically and mentally ready to enjoy everything life has to offer.
  2. The big recession we've been anticipating since 2020 will have hit, wiping out the service economy and with it
     your mortal enemy the white man. You'll have won the game and have no more to gain. (Along these lines, avoid doing
     anything aggressive before the recession, as that will likely solve all your problems anyways. "Nothing rash before
     the crash!")
  3. I assume you don't want to spend your whole life in a one-bedroom apartment and dating aging fat women with
     student loans. (Your living situation right now is actually very good. Upgrading to a worse two-bedroom would be
     foolish. So your next abode has to be a decently large estate around friendly people. There's no way to make
     that work in America, so you'll need to head out.)

  Also consider Bangkok/Saigon/Manila, Addis Ababa/Nairobi/Lagos, Mexico City/Bogota/Sao Paulo, and Lisbon/Barcelona/Nice.
  Maybe rotate between locales.
  
  Try sticking to areas well-worn by whites before you. The idea is to supplant them as globalization ends. Try reading
  literature by them from the 1950's to 1970's to model yourself after. Wherever you live, try to rent an apartment in a
  professional neighborhood near an elementary school.

  Become physically strong and good at dating. Then feel free to head out. It's a big world, and your standard of living
  should improve once you're out. You're guaranteed to become a multi-millionaire if your expenses are slashed.

* Work through Set Your Voice Free. The goal is to have a commanding, authoritative presence.
* Watch Before Sunrise and read Double Your Dating
* Read the Mexico/Philippines expat guides.
* Work through Bittman cookbooks.
* Work through MIT OpenCourseWare (Linear Algebra)
* Watch two classic films every week.
* Read classic novels and counter-narrative history books.
* Play through Steam backlog. Try touching most things, go in-depth for the masterpieces.
* Read through Kindle backlog. Try touching most things, go in-depth for the masterpieces.

Sex goals -

* Remember, the core of dating is the sex act. Until you have it mastered, there's little point. Your limiting factor
  really is physicality, so you need to get that taken care of ASAP. Try to be up to the standards of the domination
  wrestling pornos.
* Exercise. Goal is to achieve baseline competency in bench press/squat/deadlift and be a good lover.
* Start regularly fucking your fleshlights while they're on the bed. Film yourself.
  Fleshlight sitting -> Fleshlight with condom sitting -> Fleshlight on bed -> Fleshlight with condom on bed
  Wake up, pop Bluechew, stand-up, fleshlight.
* Start going out on your own. Restaurants, amusement parks, zoos. Always wearing the shoes, always keeping an eye out.
* Take up golf and fishing. Eventually be able to head out to the links or rent a boat and sail out.
* Once mastered, start visiting an escort weekly.
* Set up fake Tinder/Bumble/Hinge profiles as a female. Scope out the competition.
* Goal is a long-term relationship with an 18-21 who's deeply dependent on you. Refuse marriage. To spice things up, you
  share the occasional hooker with her in a three-some. Every 5-10 years, switch to a younger model.

Dating protocol -

* Claim to be 22 and a software engineer at __. (As economy collapses, may be able to drop pretense.)
* Keep the pepper spray on you.

Resumes being filtered out by racist HR, most likely.

https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w9873/w9873.pdf

I actually legally changed my first and last name to get past this filter. Resume response rate went from 25% to close to 100%. Extremely depressing. I advocate for all Asians to legally change our names.

At the company where I work, I'm in a position where I get to choose who we hire. But I don't get to filter the resumes myself. HR (who are led by this smug white supremacist) always send us these idiot white candidates.

One overqualified Chinese guy somehow made it through the filter and we hired him immediately, but otherwise, I've just been trying to hire white women where possible. Incompetent white women largely keep to themselves. Incompetent white males cause trouble and often try to make the non-white employees miserable.

"Good afternoon.

My name is Daniel. I came across your profile on Preferred411 and would like to set up an appointment.

Are you available at 7pm on ___ for an hour? Some other time this weekend is also fine. I live in Fremont, and can drop by Pleasanton.

Let me know what details you need. I've also requested an appointment through P411.

Thank you for your time. Look forward to hearing from you."

My criteria for "non-racist" is depressingly low.

Basically, you just have to say one normal, nice, non-patronizing thing about a non-white group. Just one sentence that isn't steeped in some horrible bigotry.

99.9% of white guys that I see on TV or that I've met IRL fail this. The younger ones are often worse than the older ones. It's insane.

I've always felt like both mainstream political parties, and white people in general, were out to get me.

You could call me a pseudo-leftist, I think. I'm very passionate about racial issues, and am willing to co-sign most feminist measures. But I'm not really a socialist. If I lived in Sweden, for example, I'd be paying a lot of taxes so white factory workers could have five kids and raise them all to hate me.

That said, I do believe in the right of all peoples to pursue their own destiny. I like China mostly because they don't try imposing their beliefs on other countries. They keep to themselves. Which is cool.

Thanks!

Darker-skinned women of all types. Black, Indian, Filipina. I live in the SF Bay Area. Most of my matches are black or Indian.

The occasional white woman sometimes matches with me, but that tends to fizzle out. I think it doesn't help that I associate white women with white men, a group I try to avoid as much as I can. When I start talking about race issues on dates, black women tend to nod along, while white women act like I insulted their religion, hahaha.

The one group I have zero success with is East Asian women. I went on a date to the local Egyptian museum with a Vietnamese girl once, but Chinese/Japanese/Korean women have basically no interest. Not sure why. I had some really great WhatsApp conversations with this Chinese girl in Shanghai who was using Tinder Passport, so I think it's an Asian-American thing.

But yeah, 3 dates, then sex/relationship. I think it's pretty standard.

(Sorry for the ramble. I rarely discuss my love-life.)

Indian-American here. Honestly, white-worshipping by Indian-American women is more of a class issue than a race issue.
The issue is that white-collar work and associated institutions (universities, HR departments, etc.) are strongly gate-kept
by white males, so Indian-American women are more or less indoctrinated into "white is right" BS. Ironically, most white
guys are downwardly socially mobile, so the Indian-American women who think this way are probably screwing over their own kids.

After staring at the state of affairs for a few years, I legally changed my name so I could have a career and started
dating working-class black women (who often despise white guys, which I love).

Yesterday, I had a 1:1 with my white, Gen X boss. We started talking about the Russia-Ukraine War, and he mentioned that
India's a "damn mess" because of the "Hindu-Muslim thing". I just nodded along sagely. A month ago he was pro-India as a
possible weapon to use against China, but now that the news is negative about India, he's apparently a crusader for Muslim
rights. Even though he almost certainly supported the invasions of Iraq/Afghanistan. Goddamn NPC.

When I meet a male like this, I try to help the guy out, but self-hating women may be a lost cause (I suspect women are
more susceptible to social pressure).

I don't want children, so I'm happy as a clam with my situation, but if I did, I'd probably move to India. I don't think
the U.S. in its current state is a good place to raise a non-white family.

When back on Tinder, set age to 22, start with good-looking image.

6'1".

I like to visit somewhere new around the Bay Area most weekends. Join me!

Let's share drinks at the beach! Or hang out at the museum! Or grab lunch. Or whatever.

"Hey, beautiful. :) "

"I'm sure you get this a lot, but you look really good."

---

Yes, but they outnumber us, and so they can exclude us.

I encourage you to change the name on your resume to one like "David Martin" and see how many more interview requests you get. The whites are screwing you over without you even knowing it.

Or, at least, this has so far been the case. As rent prices have increased over the past year, there's been a mass exodus of whites from my apartment complex, and Indian tech workers have been moving in. It's been nice.
