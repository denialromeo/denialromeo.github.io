    <blockquote>
  <p>Has everyone heard of Jack Handey’s “<a href="https://www.mit.edu/people/dmredish/wwwMLRF/links/Humor/Deep_Thoughts">Deep Thoughts</a>”?  The joke is that it’s a stupid guy trying to say deep things, like “I’d rather be rich than stupid.”
<br /> — Clayton Schwartz, <a href="http://www.2arms1head.com/"><em>2 Arms and a Head</em></a></p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<p>In her <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/22pdf/20-1199_hgdj.pdf">dissent</a> in <em>SFFA v. Harvard</em>, the 2022 Supreme Court case that banned affirmative action, justice Sonia Sotomayor noted that the U.S. is “an endemically segregated society”.</p>

<p>I barely care about affirmative action (most issues with racial disparities in academic outcomes are rooted in issues during early childhood and adolescence – college is too late to address them). But I can’t stop thinking about this phrase – “endemically segregated society”.</p>

<p>It’s really spot-on. Workplaces are segregated (I legally changed my name so I wouldn’t be forced into Indian-majority IT sweatshops). Friend groups are segregated. I even receive poor service at restaurants if my waitress or cashier happens to be white (it’s usually the uglier and poorer whites who are more racist – in practice, racism seems to be championed mostly by the lower classes).</p>

<p>Half a century after the de jure end of segregation, with a <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/children-of-color-projected-to-be-majority-of-u-s-youth-this-year">majority</a> of Americans under 18 now being non-white, white Americans still seem to champion an utterly obsolete racial identity.</p>

<p>In many ways, their insistence on this is ruining their own lives. Electing Trump directly led to a bloodless transfer of hegemony to China and Russia. Poisoning virtual and real-life spaces with racial hate mostly drives whites insane.</p>

<p>The younger white males even invent new racial slurs (e.g. “Pajeet”), which utterly baffles me. Insulting me will not improve your life. You cannot insult your way out of high cost-of-living. Outnumbering me means nothing if you cannot afford to live in my neighborhood.</p>

<p>I read online once that hating others is like consuming poison and expecting your enemy to die. The white Americans are an excellent example of this.</p>

<hr />

<p>I think an accurate view of modern life might be as a series of nested prisons – penal, wage-based, nation-based, and biology-based.</p>

<p>So you have actual prisons, right? Where you’re enslaved to perform free labor as punishment for breaking the law. But supporting that system is a wage-based prison of high costs, low salaries, and degrading, often pointless labor where the goal is escaping the system through “retirement”.</p>

<p>Fail to maintain gainful employment (either by choice or because your profession was automated or offshored), and you wind up homeless. The penalty for homelessness is, you guessed it, prison.</p>

<p>Even if you’re able to escape the above fates (by being born rich or getting lucky enough to start a successful business during a time of economic expansion), you’re still trapped by your nationality.</p>

<p>If you’re a citizen of a country that historically lost wars (e.g. India, Nigeria, Mexico), you’re trapped in your country because the currency you earn is devalued against the currencies of nations that won wars (e.g. the U.S., European nations allied with the U.S.).</p>

<p>Even being in a historical winner isn’t enough, since you have to keep winning. As the U.S. empire implodes, quality of life in the U.S. is fast approaching that of poorer countries (e.g. China has a higher lifespan than the U.S.). Being merely a millionaire here likely has diminishing returns.</p>

<p>So, to escape these prisons, you have to be born in the U.S., strike it big during a time of economic expansion, then take your winnings and leave for a poorer country trapped in the U.S. orbit (e.g. the Philippines). And you have to do this all before biological conditions make it impossible.</p>

<p>The horrific thing about being alive is that whatever you do or don’t do, you will sooner or later die. If you’re rich enough to avoid death by overwork or crime, you will still age into irrelevance as the world moves on and a younger, hardier set of people takes over.</p>

<p>So you’re in a biological prison where you have to make all your moves and get rich or die trying between the ages of 20 and 40. Before 20, you’re a slave of the school system; after 40, you’re too weak to compete with the younger people gunning for your position.</p>

<p>And that’s if you’re lucky enough to spend your adulthood in a time of economic expansion. If you graduate into a recession (2001, 2008, 2022), you’re dead before you even begin.</p>

<p>Fail to get rich (99% of people will fail) and you’ll be forced into worse and worse jobs until you eventually die of old age while working as a greeter at Walmart and living in a car.</p>

<p>It’s monstrous and inhumane. The above is why I refuse to have children. I imagine most people would mock the above as being too pessimistic, but my response is that you know I’m right – you just don’t want to admit it.</p>
