<ul>
  <li>
    <p>By the end of World War 2, India had contributed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Army_during_World_War_II">2.5 million</a> soldiers to the Allied war effort, men who were now <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Indian_Navy_mutiny">more than happy</a> to fight for their freedom.</p>

    <p>Britain, supplanted as a power by the U.S. and USSR, was too weak to hold onto India <sup>[1]</sup>.</p>

    <p>This was the biggest factor in 1947 independence. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahatma_Gandhi">Mahatma Gandhi</a> was incidental.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_War">Cold War</a> loomed, Gandhi’s disciple <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jawaharlal_Nehru">Jawaharlal Nehru</a> (India’s first prime minister) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_and_the_Non-Aligned_Movement">made it clear</a> that India would stay neutral. Wanting an ally bordering Afghanistan and Iran, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran_crisis_of_1946">targets</a> of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stalin">Stalin</a>’s expansionist Soviet Union, is why the British insisted on creating Pakistan. Religious tensions were a convenient, somewhat absurd excuse <sup>[2]</sup>.</p>

    <p>A million died in the resulting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_of_India">Partition of India</a>, and Pakistan has attacked India four times, in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-Pakistani_War_of_1947%E2%80%931948">1947</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-Pakistani_War_of_1965">1965</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-Pakistani_War_of_1971">1971</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kargil_War">1999</a>, three times over <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kashmir_conflict">Kashmir</a> and once over Bangladesh.</p>

    <p>The West’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan%E2%80%93United_States_military_relations">alliance</a> with Pakistan <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Zia-ul-Haq">proved instrumental</a> to the costly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet%E2%80%93Afghan_War">Soviet-Afghan War</a> that helped topple the USSR. However, the Pakistani government <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegations_of_support_system_in_Pakistan_for_Osama_bin_Laden">may now support terrorism</a>.</p>

    <p>Note that Pakistan’s been <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_coups_in_Pakistan">mostly under military rule</a>, and is today a democracy <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20171225102944/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/25/opinion/where-the-real-power-lies-in-pakistan.html">in name only</a>.</p>

    <p class="footnote" id="footnote-1">[1] While the U.S. ended World War 2 in 1945 by detonating atomic bombs over Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the USSR wasn’t a nuclear power until August 1949. These crucial four years are why India was hobbled by Pakistan and the institution of a foreign political system (Western capitalist democracy). China is lucky to have won independence after the Soviets got the bomb.</p>

    <p class="footnote" id="footnote-2">[2] When Pakistan was first proposed in 1933, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_of_India#Muslim_homeland,_provincial_elections,_World_War_II,_Lahore_Resolution:_1930%E2%80%931945">India’s Muslims rejected the idea</a>. Further, only the parts of India under direct British control (as opposed to the nominally autonomous “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princely_state">princely states</a>”) became part of Pakistan. Pakistan’s existence has nothing to do with religion and everything to do with Western interests in the Cold War.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The British also split Bengal into West Bengal and East Pakistan. After Pakistan murdered <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1971_Bangladesh_genocide">three million</a> East Pakistanis in 1971, East Pakistan became independent nation Bangladesh.</p>

    <p>Pakistan losing Bangladesh conflicted with American Cold War interests, so <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Nixon">Richard Nixon</a> sailed a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-Pakistani_War_of_1971#United_States_and_Soviet_Union">nuclear-armed fleet</a> into the Bay of Bengal to dissuade further Indian military action.</p>

    <p>In response, PM <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indira_Gandhi">Indira Gandhi</a> (Nehru’s daughter) signed a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-Soviet_Treaty_of_Friendship_and_Cooperation">friendship treaty</a> with the USSR, indirectly forcing the American <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Nixon%27s_1972_visit_to_China">trade deals</a> that led China to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_China">world’s largest economy</a>.</p>

    <p>In the ensuing 1962 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sino-Indian_War">Sino-Indian War</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mao_Zedong">Mao</a> invaded and annexed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aksai_Chin">Aksai Chin</a>, part of Kashmir, attacking concurrently with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuban_Missile_Crisis">Cuban Missile Crisis</a> so the USSR couldn’t intervene. This led India to develop nuclear weapons and Mao’s CPC to <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jamyang-norbu/who-created-pakistans-nuc_b_864124.html">give</a> Pakistan nuclear technology, which Pakistan <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea%E2%80%93Pakistan_relations#Allegations_of_nuclear_assistance_by_Pakistan">may have passed</a> to North Korea.</p>

    <p>Note that during the tensions that led to the Sino-Indian War (1959 – 1961), Mao’s CPC murdered <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/notes/19629880-tombstone/71655209-daniel-moore">45 million</a> Chinese <sup>[3]</sup> <sup>[4]</sup> <sup>[5]</sup>.</p>

    <p class="footnote" id="footnote-3">[3] British imperialism in China caused <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiping_Rebellion">30 million deaths</a> in the 1850-1864 Taiping Rebellion, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/notes/19323009-late-victorian-holocausts/71655209-daniel-moore">starved 20 million</a> from 1876-1879, ended the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qing_dynasty">Qing Empire</a>, and <a href="https://www.theglobalist.com/european-imperialism-in-asia/">weakened China</a> enough for Imperial Japan to murder <a href="http://zakkeith.com/articles,blogs,forums/anti-Chinese-persecution-in-the-USA-history-timeline.htm#footnote46">35 million</a> Chinese in World War 2, setting the stage for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Civil_War">civil war</a> that led to Mao’s CPC seizing power in 1949. So all this still goes back to the British.</p>

    <p class="footnote" id="footnote-4">[4] The Sino-Indian War may have been an attempt by Mao to distract CPC rivals from the results of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Leap_Forward">Great Leap Forward</a>. It’s worth noting that India re-normalized relations with China shortly after Mao’s death, and that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_Revolution">Cultural Revolution</a> was also a way for Mao to override the broader CPC and remain in power.</p>

    <p class="footnote" id="footnote-5">[5] Mao’s CPC and the CPC post-Mao are very different entities, to the point that the CPC denounced Mao’s Cultural Revolution as the worst set-back in PRC history. As well, the modern CPC has around <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Communist_Party">100 million</a> party members, promising stability.</p>
